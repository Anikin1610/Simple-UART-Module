# Simple-UART-Module
A UART module for use in a FPGA

## Introduction
  UART is a serial communication system which doesn't require a clock to synchronize between the transmitter and reciever. It sends data 1 bit at a time from the LSB to MSB and is framed by a start bit (generally logic '0') and a stop bit (generally logic '1').
